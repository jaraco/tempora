======

#21: Restored dependency on ``jaraco.functools``, still
used in timing module.

v5.2.0
======

Remove dependency on jaraco.functools.

v5.1.1
======

Packaging refresh.

v5.1.0
======

Introduced ``infer_datetime`` and added some type hints.

v5.0.2
======

- Refreshed project.
- Enrolled with Tidelift.

v5.0.1
======

- Refreshed project.

v5.0.0
======

- Removed deprecated ``divide_*`` functions and ``Parser``
  class.
- Require Python 3.7 or later.
- #19: Fixed error reporting in parse_timedelta.

v4.1.2
======

- #18: Docs now build without warnings.

v4.1.1
======

- Fixed issue where digits were picked up in the unit when
  adjacent to the last unit.

v4.1.0
======

- Added support for more formats in ``parse_timedelta``.
- #17: ``parse_timedelta`` now supports formats emitted by
  ``timeit``, including honoring nanoseconds at the
  microsecond resolution.

v4.0.2
======

- Refreshed package metadata.

v4.0.1
======

- Refreshed package metadata.

v4.0.0
======

- Removed ``strptime`` function in favor of
  `datetime.datetime.strptime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>`_. If passing
  a ``tzinfo`` parameter, instead invoke `.replace(tzinfo=...)`
  on the result.
- Deprecated ``divide_timedelta`` and ``divide_timedelta_float``
  now that Python supports this functionality natively.
- Deprecated ``Parser`` class. The
  `dateutil.parser <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html>`_
  provides more sophistication.

v3.0.0
======

- #10: ``strftime`` now reverts to the stdlib behavior for
  ``%u``. Use tempora 2.1 or later and the ``%µ`` for
  microseconds.

v2.1.1
======

- #8: Fixed error in ``PeriodicCommandFixedDelay.daily_at``
  when timezone is more than 12 hours from UTC.

v2.1.0
======

- #9: Fixed error when date object is passed to ``strftime``.
- #11: ``strftime`` now honors upstream expectation of
  rendering date values on time objects and vice versa.
- #10: ``strftime`` now honors ``%µ`` for rendering just
  the "microseconds" as ``%u`` supported previously.
  In a future, backward-incompatible release, the
  ``%u`` behavior will revert to the behavior as found
  in stdlib.

v2.0.0
======

* Require Python 3.6 or later.
* Removed DatetimeConstructor.
